When things pile up, they cause issues.Types of congestive heart failureTypes of congestive heart failure include:Left-sided heart failure.Right-sided heart failure.High-output heart failure. This is a rare type of congestive heart failure.How common is congestive heart failure?More than 6 million people in the United States have congestive heart failure. It’s the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65.Symptoms and CausesWhat are the congestive heart failure symptoms?Congestive heart failure symptoms include:Shortness of breath.Waking up short of breath at night.Chest pain.Heart palpitations.Fatigue when you’re active.Swellingin your ankles, legs and abdomen.Weight gain.Need to urinate while resting at night.A dry, hacking cough.A full (bloated) or hard stomach.Loss of appetite or upset stomach (nausea).Sometimes, you may have mild symptoms of congestive heart failure or none at all. This doesn’t mean you don’t have heart failure anymore. Symptoms of heart failure can range from mild to severe and may come and go.Unfortunately, congestive heart failure usually gets worse over time. As it worsens, you may have more or different signs or symptoms.AdvertisementWhat causes congestive heart failure?Causes of congestive heart failure include:Coronary artery diseaseand/orheart attack.Cardiomyopathy(genetic or viral).Heart issues present at birth(congenital heart disease).Diabetes.High blood pressure(hypertension).Arrhythmia.Kidney disease.Abody mass index (BMI)higher than 30.Tobacco and recreational drug use.Alcohol use.Medications such as cancer drugs (chemotherapy).Left-sided heart failure is the most common cause of right-sided heart failure. When your left ventricle isn’t working correctly, it allows blood to back up. At some point, this backup affects your right ventricle. Other causes include certain lung problems and issues in other organs.What are the risk factors for congestive heart failure?Risk factors for congestive heart failure include:Being older than 65.Using tobacco products, cocaine or alcohol.Having an inactive (sedentary) lifestyle.Eating foods that have a lot of salt and fat.Having high blood pressure.Having coronary artery disease.Having a heart attack.Having a family history of congestive heart failure.What are the complications of congestive heart failure?Some of the complications from congestive heart failure include:Irregular heartbeat.Sudden cardiac arrest.Heart valve problems.A collection of fluid in your lungs.Pulmonary hypertension.Kidney damage.Liver damage.Malnutrition.Diagnosis and TestsHow is congestive heart failure diagnosed?Your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and medical history.

There are four heart failure stages (Stages A, B, C and D). They range from having a high risk of developing heart failure to having advanced heart failure.Stage AStage A (pre-heart failure) means you’re at a high risk of developing heart failure because you have a family history of congestive heart failure or you have one or more of these medical conditions:Hypertension.Diabetes.Coronary artery disease.Metabolic syndrome.History ofalcohol use disorder.History ofrheumatic fever.Family history of cardiomyopathy.History of taking drugs that can damage your heart muscle, such as some cancer drugs.Stage BStage B (pre-heart failure) means your left ventricle isn’t working well and/or is structurally abnormal but you’ve never had symptoms of heart failure.AdvertisementStage CPeople with Stage C heart failure have a congestive heart failure diagnosis and currently have or previously had signs and symptoms of the condition.Stage D and reduced EF (ejection fraction)People who have Stage D HFrEF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) have advanced symptoms that don’t get better with treatment. This is the final stage of heart failure.What tests will be done to diagnose congestive heart failure?Common tests to identify congestive heart failure, its stage and its cause include:Blood tests.Cardiac catheterization.Chest X-ray.Echocardiogram.Heart MRI(magnetic resonance imaging).Cardiac computed tomography (CT).Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG).Multigated Acquisition Scan (MUGA scan).Stress test.Genetic testing.Management and TreatmentHow is congestive heart failure treated?Your treatment will depend on the type of heart failure you have and, in part, what caused it.
