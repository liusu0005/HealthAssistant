The four valves are the mitral, aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves. The valves open and close to keep blood flowing in the proper direction through your heart. When something is wrong with one of the valves, the blood cannot flow in and out of the heart properly. Problems with the heart valves can cause leaks (valve regurgitation) and blockages (valve stenosis). You can be born with heart valve disease, or it can develop over a number of years.Mild cases of heart valve disease may not cause problems, but more serious cases will weaken the heart and can lead to heart failure. Treatment with medicine can help relieve symptoms, but it will not fix the valve. You may choose to have the valve replaced or repaired.Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety.Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor or nurse advice line (811in most provinces and territories) if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.How can you care for yourself at home?Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor or nurse advice line if you think you are having a problem with your medicine. You will get more details on the specific medicines your doctor prescribes.Eat a heart-healthy diet. For example, eat more fruits, vegetables, fish, lean meats, whole grains, and other high-fibre foods. Limit sodium, sugar, and alcohol.Be active. Ask your doctor what type and level of exercise is safe for you. Walking is a good choice. You also may want to swim, bike, or do other activities.Stay at a healthy weight. Lose weight if you need to.Do not smoke. Smoking can cause more heart problems. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances of quitting for good.Manage other health problems. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. If you think you may have a problem with alcohol or drug use, talk to your doctor.Avoid infections such as COVID-19, colds, and influenza (flu). Get a pneumococcal vaccine. If you have had one before, ask your doctor if you need another dose. Get a flu vaccine every year. Stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.Take care of your teeth and gums. Get regular dental checkups. Good dental health is important because bacteria can spread from infected teeth and gums to the heart valves.If you have had a valve repaired or replaced, you may need to take antibiotics before you have certain dental or surgical procedures.When should you call for help?Call911anytime you think you may need emergency care.
